<h1>Design Decisions</h1>
<p>Our css is futuristic/galaxy themed. We picked this theme because it is modern, cool, and also results
 in a calming color pallete.</p>
 <h3>Details and Features</h3>
 <p>To achieve this theme, we chose a high definition image of the night sky, including the milky way galaxy. 
 Having the image fill the screen and be fixed gives the page depth as the other objects scroll infront of it.</p> 
 
 <p>We also chose two fonts, one for regular text and one for headers, that are both futuristic. The headings font is more
 stylized while the regular text font is easier to read while still keeping the futuristic feel. </p>
 
 <p>We also utilized a lot of hover selectors. This adds to the futuristic mood and also gives a higher contrasting background to 
 the elements you are currently focusing on. This effect is achieved by controlling the opacity of the objects being hovered over. </p>
 
 <p> Also, every color chosen in our css design came directly from the background image. This helps the design feel unified throughout
 every element and page. The text is always in high contract to the backgroung while preserving the color theme. We also added a black shadow around words that do not have a background box to improve the contrast between 
 them and the background. We inlcuded spacing between the elements to make use of empty space on the screen and to allow the elements 
 to be read more easily. In the day boxes, only the links have hover elements and therefore change color. This is to help prevent 
 confusion between what is and isn't a link when working on assignments.</p>
